          Sriram is a final year doctoral student at the Virology Institute in MÃ¼nster, Germany. During his bachelors and masters in Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Chennai, he worked on several projects aimed at synthesizing adsorptive agents using biological waste products, to remove, recycle and reuse various heavy metals from industrial effluents. His team received funding from the Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises (ABLE) through the Biotechnology Entrepreneurship Student Teams (BEST) program, and from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, through the PALS Innovation Challenge, to scale-up their system. His technical experience in this front helped the team improve our project. Born and brought-up in a family of professors and teachers, Sriram values and regards mentorship as the most rewarding aspect of an academic career, and hence serves several mentoring groups, including the iGEM Mentors Committee. Sriram is an iGEM Veteran: He was the Advisor for 2017, 2018 and 2019 iGEM Teams of REC-CHENNAI, and was a Judge for iGEM 2020, all of which helped the team navigate through the competition.

          Dhwani Teckchandani is a rising senior pursuing a Bachelor's in Biochemical Engineering and
          Biotechnology. Her love for life sciences stemmed from a novel she chanced upon in high school,
          "Perfect People" by Peter James, and she has been hooked ever since. In her pursuit to encourage
          interdisciplinary research in life sciences, she has worked on game-theoretic approaches for
          modelling biological systems and iGEM is another avenue for her to work with a diverse team.
          Synthetic biology is her first experience with tangible research outputs that directly translate
          into societal upliftment, which has proven to be a potent motivator. Apart from absolutely
          everything life sciences, Dhwani enjoys music, passionate discussions about things ranging from
          sitcoms to alien invasions, and an eerie amount of crime documentaries.
