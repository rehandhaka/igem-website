            Human Practices was a way to steer our project towards social responsibility and realism for us as a team.
            Through
            our project, we hope to contribute to the resolution of the global problem of lead poisoning. Inspired by
            the
            approaches used in responsible research and innovation, we combined the ELSA approach and AR to anticipate
            issues
            that may arise from our project's large-scale implementation in the future. We ensure that the insights
            gained
            from
            this are addressed significantly in the current implementation of our project. Our human practices
            initiatives
            were
            used not only to guide our project, but also to aid in the relief of lead poisoning in India even beyond the
            project, truly embodying the spirit of "locals solving local problems."</p>

          <p>Thus, human practices were primarily used to gain insights into our project's technicalities whenever we

            stuck. <br>
            1. Obtaining insights into our project's ethical, legal, and social feasibility. <br>

      <div class="whiteBlock">
        <p class="para">While investigating lead poisoning as a problem and assisting in its resolution through
          synthetic
          biology, we
          discovered that: <br></p>
        <p class="point_heading para">1. Detection of lead in samples is a problem in and of itself:</p>
        <p class="para">The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) changed the blood lead reference value from
          5
          milligrams per
          decilitre to 3.5 milligrams per decilitre in October 2021. This was the first change in the reference value in
          nearly a decade, implying that Lead affects an increasing number of children. Furthermore, we discovered that
          current lead detection methods are performed in high-end labs, only centralizing the process and delaying
          decision-making by governing bodies to prevent lead poisoning. As a result, we concentrated on resolving this
          issue
          by proposing a biosensor that can be accessed locally to quickly quantify lead at a decentralized level.
          Biosafety
          concerns were raised with our biosensor during the course of our project, so we proposed using biosensors for
          isolated samples in an isolated system. These isolated samples could be water or soil, two of India's most
          common
          sources of lead poisoning.</p> <br>
        <p class="point_heading para">2. Dangerous lead levels in drinking water are used daily:</p>
        <p class="para">In most of the samples collected from water bodies across India, we discovered through a
          literature
          review that lead content in water is three to four times higher than BIS specifications. As a result, we
          proposed
          incorporating a lead recovery system without a project to assist in the recovery of lead from water samples.
          Again,
          we recognized a biosafety concern for this system, so we proposed using a bioreactor to ensure biocontainment
          of
          the
          engineered cells.</p> <br>
        <p class="point_heading para">3. People in India are not aware of the dangers of lead poisoning:</p>
        <p class="para">We conducted a survey to assess IIT Delhi students' knowledge of lead poisoning. According to
          the
          survey, 2 of 10 people from India's top technological institutions classified 'lead as a nutrient.' The survey
          also
          revealed a general lack of knowledge about common sources of lead poisoning and the diagnosis and prognosis of
          lead
          poisoning. This inspired us to spread the word about lead poisoning and figure out how to approach
          stakeholders
          for
          actionable insights.</p> <br>
        <p class="point_heading para">4. In India, there is a lack of understanding of synthetic biology: </p>
        <p class="para">We also conducted a Synthetic Biology survey at IIT Delhi and discovered that most people are
          unaware
          of the field and its implications. As a result, we integrated the synthetic biology education initiative into
          our
          human practices.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="blueExperimentDataBlock">
        <p class="para">We proposed a technological solution for lead positioning: a biosensor and lead recovery system
          based
          on synthetic biology. However, the third and fourth points were impediments to steering our technocratic
          solution
          toward a democratic solution. This was because lead poisoning is a precursor to the majority of the diseases
          that
          people are concerned about. Furthermore, because blood lead levels are not tested in India, most affected
          people
          are
          unaware they are victims. Even if they were aware that they were affected, they have no idea why, and they
          simply
          ignore it because most jobs involving lead poisoning in India employ people from very poor backgrounds, so
          they
          prioritize their livelihood over their well-being. The general public's lack of awareness of Synthetic Biology
          is
          due to a lack of education in this field. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="whiteBlock">
        <p class="para">As a result of the aforementioned issues, gathering insights from the primary stakeholders
          affected
          was time-consuming and inefficient. We decided ELSA was the most suitable framework for our project because we
          wanted to investigate its potential ethical, legal, and social aspects, not just its implications as the ELSA
          framework may imply. We decided not to follow the AREA framework because they were unsuitable for our project.
          AREA
          relied on a level of engagement with end users that were unavailable to us since our primary stakeholders were
          unaware of lead poisoning.
        </p>
        <p class="para">So we decided to work around the problem by speaking with stakeholders and experts in the field
          of
          lead poisoning
          and synthetic biology.
          We identified experts in the following fields:
        </p>
        <ul class="para">
          <li>Public Health Policy</li>
          <li>Occupational Health and Safety Policy</li>
          <li>Policy on Synthetic Biology</li>
          <li>Treatment of Wastewater</li>
          <li>Biosafety</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="blueGreyishBlock">
        <p class="para">Interacting with these experts provides insights into how, in our case, implementing our project
          using
          the precautionary principle can help us create a larger impact in a shorter time frame. The precautionary
          principle
          was suggested by prioritizing the lead recovery system used in our project to recover lead from
          lead-contaminated
          water samples, developed on our IHP page (add the Integrated Human Practices link here). Also, there were
          interactions suggesting biosafety protocols and the economic value of our implementation. These interactions
          were
          used to incorporate insights into our project to have a broader and greater impact over the course of the
          project
          and in the future.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="whiteBlock">
        <p class="para">We used our human practices not only to steer the project toward social responsibility and
          realism
          but
          also to seek technical expertise whenever we encountered technical difficulties while implementing our
          technocratic
          solution. We contacted experts in the following fields on numerous occasions:</p>
        <ol class="para">
          <li>Structural Modeling</li>
          <li>Mathematical Modeling</li>
          <li>Microfluidics</li>
          <li>Biosensors</li>
          <li>Bioreactors</li>
          <li>Synthetic Biology</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para">These reach-outs were sometimes explicit, as when we contacted our institute's professors and
          seniors
          for immediate advice to unclog our pipeline whenever we were stuck. Sometimes our requests were implicit, so
          we
          asked experts to review our work/methodology and make any necessary changes to assist us in realizing and
          improving
          our project technically.</p>
        <p class="para">These are the key human practices initiatives we used to guide our project through its various
          stages.

      <div class="blueExperimentDataBlock">
        <h2 id="surveys">Surveys</h2>
        <p class="para">The survey's advantage lies in the simplicity with which it was designed to handle and quantify
          the
          data that we have recovered and the potential volume of responses. Even though it doesn't return in-depth
          answers
          like in personal interviews, if the survey is done well and receives a sufficient number of responses, it can
          still
          give a broad sense of what awareness the public has.
        </p>
        <p class="para">Intending to assess the current awareness about lead pollution among people, iGEM IIT Delhi
          conducted
          two surveys about lead poisoning. Survey questions were designed to achieve our goal to understand the current
          state
          of awareness regarding lead poisoning and contamination along with facilitating the spread of information
          about
          lead
          pollution, like the primary cause, effect, and testing methods for lead poisoning, through an interactive
          survey.
          This not only helped us assess but also educate at the same time. <br>
          While conducting the survey, we ensured that the participants had complete information about the subsequent
          use
          of
          the information gathered by the iGEM project at IIT Delhi. Additionally, it was anonymous to ensure the
          privacy
          of
          the respondents.</p>

        <div class="para">
          <p>We conducted the domestic survey among the Indian public, with most participants being students between the

          <p>The questions were designed taking lead poisoning statistics and sources collected from government
            websites and
            past research papers. <br>
            For this survey, we collaborated with the Board of Student Publications(BSP), the journalistic body of IIT
            Delhi
            ,
            to reach out to the relevant participants and for subsequent distribution of the survey results to spread
            awareness. The survey link was also shared through our Instagram page and publicly displayed in our
            presentation
            at the All India iGEM Meet 2022 at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. <br> <br>

        <h3 class="para">Results from the survey:
        </h3>
        <p class="para">The findings suggested a concerning level of ignorance in the community about the sources of
          lead
          exposure and the harmful consequences of its prolonged exposure.
          93.2% of people have never encountered anyone who has undergone testing for lead poisoning. Only a tiny
          fraction
          of
          4.5% of people have their water pipes checked, while most people are unaware whether their water supply pipes
          are
          leaded or not. This question was also accompanied by an image with the instructions to perform a simple test
          to
          check for leaded pipes to promote testing at an individual level. Since 35.3% of people never thought about
          paint
          as
          a potential source and 19.3% believed that packing food in newspapers cannot expose you to lead poisoning,
          there
          seems to be a serious requirement for spreading awareness about it.

        <h3 class="para">Global Survey:</h3>
        <p class="para">The global survey was a modified domestic survey conducted to understand this issue's perception
          and
          awareness in diverse methodologies and countries. To get global responses, we collaborated with the Office of
          International Programs, IIT Delhi, and also used the iGEM global slack channel as a platform to reach other
          international teams. Through this initiative, we understood the diversity of the issue and the importance of
          our
          project in different countries. </p>
        <p class="para">The Global Survey helped us understand the level of awareness of people in different countries
          and
          how
          safety with respect to lead poisoning was dealt with in their geographies. <br>This information helped us
          establish
          two things: <br>
          1. Identify areas of growth for awareness in the Indian Context and how other countries had dealt with this
          <br>
          2. To establish scope of iGEM IITD’s work in geographies other than the home location, i.e., beyond India

          and incorporate these messages into the project design. Additionally, it helped us gain a larger view on the
          applicability of this project and better isolate our use cases, and subsequently our market size as well. <br>
          Following this, we also set up an initiative to spread awareness through a social campaign on the IITD campus.
          In
          which we put up posters on awareness regarding lead poisoning in general areas to sensitize people regarding

            approaching, engaging and analysing stakeholders in the appropriate way. <br>
            Moreover, we ensured we were consulting as many relevant stakeholders as possible, from different
            backgrounds

            could
            make it better. <br>
            In order to determine these methodologies, we reviewed the projects of the outstanding iGEM teams in
            previous
            years for inspiration and make sure to adapt our methods to each situation. <br>
            We also conducted research on our side and discussed frequently amongst ourselves to evaluate our current
            methodology and ensure it was still responding to our needs.
          </p>
          <p>We began by contacting our stakeholders through email. In this email, we introduced ourselves, our project,
            why
            we are interested in approaching that particular stakeholder, and also attached a project pamphlet. We asked
            whether they would be interested in sharing their insights in an online interview. Meeting online lowered
            the
            threshold to meet with people from different regions, it allowed us to reach out to stakeholders not only in
            New
            Delhi, but also, for example, in Bangalore and Maharashtra.

      <div class="whiteBlock">
        <div class="para">
          <p>In addition, we asked for informed consent to share our insights from this interview, including the name
            and
            photograph of the interviewee on our wiki page.
          </p>
          <p>While meeting on more theoretical matters such as biosensor simulation or lead poisoning policies could
            occur
            online, we found it essential to visit wastewater treatment plants in person, so as to truly grasp the
            contexts
            in
            which our project would live. <br>
            We tried reaching lead-based industries through email available on their website. But after getting no
            responses
            we changed our approach and tried to reach out to the employees of these industries on LinkedIn. But
            unfortunately, we were unable to get any replies. <br>
            By contacting numerous NGOs and social activist groups, we attempted to get in touch with lead poisoning
            victims.
            We were unable to identify any social activist organizations serving only the needs of lead poisoning
            sufferers
            in
            India, nevertheless. <br>
            Then, we adopted a different strategy, broadened our emphasis, and made an email-based outreach effort to
            environmental NGOs with a similar objective to stop heavy metal poisoning. We started making cold calls to
            them
            after receiving no response, but regrettably, no one answered. <br>
            As a result of these constraints, we find ourselves in a position where we are unable to develop meaningful
            relationships with those who are suffering from lead poisoning. However, iGEM IITD does recognise these
            individuals as significant stakeholders in our analyses.
          </p>
          <p>To ensure our implementation was realistic, and to have an idea of the system it would be immersing itself
            in,
            we
            visited a wastewater treatment plant in IIT Delhi. During our visit, we held interviews with personnel
            there.
            He
            was able to inform us about the functioning of the facility and gave us an overview of the work they perform
            there. <br>

          <p>The ethical, legal, and social approach, often known as ELSA, was chosen as the guiding principle for
            our project.
            People at risk of lead poisoning were designated as the primary stakeholders in our project. To orient our
            initiative toward social responsibility and reality, we consulted specialists in public health, occupational
            health,
            synthetic biology policy, wastewater treatment, and biosensors from all around India.</p>
          <p>According to those knowledgeable in health and public policy, the first thing that should be done when
            there is a
            cause for concern (such as detecting high BLLs) is to implement the precautionary principle. Also, the
            inputs
            obtained by experts working on Biosensors were suggested in favor of lead recovery systems given the time
            scale
            of
            our project. As a result, we decided that prioritizing the lead recovery system would significantly impact
            our
            project in a shorter amount of time. As a result, we decided to prioritize our efforts in the wet lab on
            lead
            recovery systems over biosensors. Here, we do have to acknowledge that the Biosensor we are proposing is an
            essential device for effective decision-making and future research on lead poisoning. We also studied system
            utility
            preferences (Lead Recovery or Lead Biosensor). The former, which had a more comprehensive range of
            applications,
            resulted in a more significant agreement. The acceptability of our project has been ensured.</p>
          <p>In the wet lab, we had support from specialists in India's policy regarding synthetic biology and
            biosensors.
            During our conversations, we concluded that using immobilized cells rather than microfluidics may make our
            biosensor more efficient in terms of cost and time, so we incorporated that. The suggested operation for
            treating
            wastewater will be more effective if it uses an immobilized cell technology. During our interactions, the
            experts
            working on synthetic biology policy made us aware of the implications of genetically engineered bacteria.
            They
            helped us guide towards effective proposed implementation in India because of their input on regulating the
            use
            of
            GMOs in India. </p>

        </div>
        <br> <br>
        <div class="para">
          <p>Dr. Arati works at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in TIFR, India. Her primary work is in the
            class of non-coding RNAs called riboswitches, which directly bind cellular metabolites to control the
            expression of downstream genes.
            <br> <br>
            Dr. Arati gave extremely insightful inputs with regards to safety, structural modelling and implementation
            of the project. In terms of structural modelling she advised that we needed to be extremely careful in
            interpreting our results when performing metal-protein docking, primarily because a metal ion by itself is
            an extremely small entity and current modelling softwares may not be that sophisticated to be able to
            accurately dock it with the protein and measure the binding affinity. Her rationale made us realise an
            improved strategy for molecular docking by measuring the best binding in terms of conformational stability
            of the complex after binding instead of trying to assess affinity. This helped us improve our understanding
            of current limitations and methods in structural modelling techniques.
            <br> <br>
            In terms of the implementation, we also discussed progressing towards cell-free systems for the biosensor
            instead of a whole-cell system. She pointed out the crucial limitations of a cell-free system: even for the
            proper functioning of the machinery without the cell, it would require optimum pH, temperature, and salt
            conditions, among others. In the absence of a cell, these aren’t automatically regulated and could hamper
            the system’s functioning in the presence of environmental samples. On the other hand, whole-cell systems can
            regulate these conditions better, even in ecological samples, making them more reliable and stable. However,
            biocontainment is guaranteed in cell-free systems, unlike whole-cell ones. This tradeoff would have to be
            resolved by properly designing a contained environment like the microfluidic array for the biosensor.
            <br> <br>
            She also posed interesting evolutionary questions regarding what kind of selection pressures this would put
            on our engineered <i> E. coli </i>, whether exposure to high concentrations of lead for recovery and detection could
            cause it to adapt to develop resistance to the heavy metal over time and what kind of implications this
            could have.

            parallels and differences between the two since he had varied experiences. We discussed how synthetic
            biology is progressing in India and what we can do as students to promote and accelerate its growth. We
            identified that poor science communication is among the primary reasons for people, especially those who are
            not well-versed with life sciences, to be averse to the idea of synthetic biology. Terms like “unnatural,”
            often used in media to describe synthetic biology innovations, makes it seem like a scary unregulated
            affair. We discussed how it was essential to improve methods of communication of engineering biology along
            with stressing on discussions on bioethics and safety to help this field progress further. He reflected on

            He made us realize that the microfluidic device we wished to design for the biosensor would require a lot of precision as well as optimization and might not turn out the way we want it to in merely the first trial. Also, due to the unavailability of resources and limited time, it would be difficult for us to fabricate such a device. As an alternative, he introduced to us a very logical approach that might even turn out to be better than making a microfluidic device, i.e., immobilization of cells using calcium alginate / low melting agarose. He pointed out that all we need are cells trapped in a porous medium enough for the exchange of nutrients and gases from the surroundings, which would allow it to perfectly fit into our idea.

Forming a biofilm of lead adsorbing bacteria could be an exciting application of our system once we characterize its ability to interact with lead. We could use this to develop more efficient lead adsorbing strategies. He also suggested using a consortium of our lead adsorbing bacteria expressing different lead-binding proteins to test if a combination could outperform individual types of the engineered bacteria. These were among the most out-of-the-box problems we had thought about in our project as possible implementations of it in the future.

            She has experience in developing a biosensor to detect Arsenic poisoning in blood. She says that metal recovery is the next big thing to work on, as a lot of work has already been done on detection. She believes that in the future, we could integrate a thresholding metal detection circuit with lead-recovery cells. This won’t increase the complexity like that of an oscillating sensor while also helping us achieve two objectives. Additionally, a circuit to express the short domain of PbrR as the surface protein for lead detection could also help improve efficiency by reducing the bacterial load. Initially, we planned to use heat shock to weaken the lead-protein binding and recover lead from the bacteria. However, Dr. Swathi recommended using agents like HNO3 to precipitate lead, as heat might denature the protein and make the system unsustainable. We followed her advice in our wet lab and received positive results.
