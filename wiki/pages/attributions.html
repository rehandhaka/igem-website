        iGEM has allowed our team to foster a community of synthetic biology enthusiasts who have ideated and executed this project. The team is grateful to the iGEM foundation for facilitating this opportunity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The team is extremely grateful to our PI, SI, advisors, sponsors, and our institute, IIT Delhi, for supporting this endeavor. Their support and guidance were integral to our success.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This project is ideated and executed entirely by the undergraduate team members with guidance from our faculty and advisors. Our journey with iGEM began in January 2022 when the team began ideating the project. We brainstormed through multiple potential
        project ideas throughout the month and settled on a feasible yet impactful idea with the help of our PI. We strategized the entire workflow and cloning strategy through the months of February and May to concretize the idea. We began ordering the
        consumables and the safety training in the month of May with the help of our advisors, instructor, and lab technicians. Since then, the wet lab, dry lab, human practices, marketing, and social media and outreach divisions have worked independently
        on their sub-objectives to achieve the shared goal of addressing lead poisoning and contamination. We have received constant support from our PI, SI, and mentors throughout the project.
