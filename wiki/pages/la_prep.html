    <h3>LA (solid media) preparation</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="para">
        1. Add 2 g of Luria Broth mixture to 100 mL of distilled water to make 2% w/v solution in an Erlenmeyer flask.
        <br>
        2. Mix well to form a uniform solution. <br>
        3. Add 1.5 g of Agar Agar powder to the solution and mix well to make a uniform 1.5% w/v solution. <br>
        4. Make an air-tight cotton plug and close the mouth of the flask using the plug. <br>
        5. Autoclave the flask at 121â„ƒ, 15 psi pressure for 20-25 minutes. (Cover the cotton plug and the mouth of the
        flask with a piece of Aluminum foil before keeping inside the autoclave). <br>
        6. While the media is still in liquid form, pour ~25 mL of media in 4 sterile petri plates each inside a laminar
        hood. <br>
        7. Let the media solidify inside the laminar hood. <br>
        8. Once solidified, cover the petri plates with their lids and seal them using parafilm. <br>
        9. Sterile solid media is ready for use.
